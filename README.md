# wbTeamPro Language Files

This repository is a warehouse for the language files provided with the wbTeamPro Project Management for WHMCS software suite.

Language files are named to mirror the language files included with WHMCS.  The language file selected by wbTeamPro during runtime is determined by the language of the active user, or system defaults defined in WHMCS.

All language files include an include('english.php') line to import the default "enlish.php" values before being overwritten.
